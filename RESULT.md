- Maximum number of connections that can be handled before connection drops: 26
- Maximum number of requests per second that can be sustained by the server when operating with maximum number of connections: 181
- Average and 99 percentile of response time:
    - Time per request: 143.700 ms (mean)
    - Time per request: 5.527 ms (mean, across all concurrent requests)
    - 99 percentile: 433 ms
- Utilization when max performance is sustained:
    - CPU: 99.67% idle
    - Memory: 420MB used
    - Disk IO: bi: 52 blocks/s bo: 1967 blocks/s
    - Network: recv: 341KB/s, send: 83KB/s
